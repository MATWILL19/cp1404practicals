# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I would usually end up underestimating the time needed, though it did get more accurate towards the nd of the subject.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It improved somewhat but was still inaccurate. I feel as though not giving an estimate until the task is fully understood would yield more accurate estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

You cannot accurately determine the time needed until you have fully understood what is being requested of you
## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

That it very easy to overlook simple mistakes, and that code initially intended to be placeholder may end being unintentionally permanent.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

That there always something you can learn from someone else that will improve your own code; from simpler and easier to read functions to better organised code in general. In general though I felt like I didn't have much to suggest
given my own coding struggles, and most of my feedback was fairly basic.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Pull Request Review prac_09](https://github.com/Moggie269/cp1404practicals/pull/6#pullrequestreview-2471403671)

### Explanation

I thought this a review to be a good one; the submission only had two notable issues with that I thought needing addressing. 
I feel the feedback is helpful and tonally appropriate.

### Good Code Review 2

[Pull Request Review prac_07](https://github.com/Jordan-Whiteside/cp1404practicals/pull/4#issuecomment-2485651284)

### Explanation

I believe this review to be a good one, that points out several flaws with the submission without being harsh and deferring to the lecturer where I am unsure.
The only thing I might consider inappropriate would be the comment that I struggled with the same issue they did; may not be appropriate in a professional environment and 
perhaps should have been written as a redirect to the lecturer.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I honestly found the practicals to be well suited to the subject matter being taught; most of my difficulties with them were self-inflicted.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I don't think I did well very overall, but I do feel like my problem solving skills, particularly being able to find what materials/demo/docs I need to understand problems, have steadily improved throughout the semester. 
And though it is a small thing, I feel like I was consistent with my docstrings and writing good variable names.

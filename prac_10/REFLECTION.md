# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I would usually end up underestimating the time needed, though it did get more accurate

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It improved somewhat but was still innaccurate. I feel as though not giving an estimate until the task is fully understood would yield more accurate estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

You cannot accurately determine the time needed until you have fully understood what is being requested of you
## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

That it very easy to overlook simple mistakes, and that code initially intended to be placeholder may end being unintentionally permanent.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

That there always something you can learn from someone else that will improve your own code; from simpler and easier to read functions to better organised code in general.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I honestly found the practicals to be well suited to the subject matter being taught; most of my difficulties with them were self-inflicted.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I don't think I did well very overall, but I do feel like my problem solving skills have steadily improved throughout the semester. And though it is small, I feel like I was consistent with my docstrings and writing good variable names.

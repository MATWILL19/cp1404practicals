## About this Repository
This repository contains the practical work completed during my study of the CP1404 Programming 2 subject.

## About Me
I am a first year engineering student, majoring in electrical engineering and studying a minor in software.

## Lessons on clean coding
- Readable Code: Using appropriate naming conventions for all code, using informative docstring/comments and following established coding patterns
- Reusable Code: Creating appropriate functions, classes and methods that follow the single responsibility principle
- Efficient Code: Follow the DRY (Do not repeat yourself) principle, appropriate selection of "look before you leap" or "Better to ask forgiveness" error handling

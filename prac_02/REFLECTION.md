# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

Around 50%, though I have made the effort to read the lecture notes

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I intend to give them a 3 to 4 hour block on Monday and Tuesday Afternoons starting next week, in my study room

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I feel my actual code writing in this subject is at a good level; but it is a bit too early to tell in my opinion
Otherwise I think what material I have learnt in lectures and seminars is remaining in my memory

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I am struggling to make time for this subject at the moment; the lateness of submission speaks to that
Going forward I intend to make better use of my time to prevent it from happening again

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Making time for them! 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

As said above I feel my coding writing output is the only thing on track at this point
